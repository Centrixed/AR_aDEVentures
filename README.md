# AR aDEVentures
This github contains the current(ish) working Unity directory for my AR testing & developments. I will update it periodically along with each new post to [my blog](https://blog.mattundie.com/)!

**Note:**
- Requires [Unity 2021.1.0f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- This repo contains just the assets folder, you will need to create your own project and import the assets yourself.
- Must use the latest Unity Packages for AR Foundation and ARKit.
- This is being deployed for testing using [this incredible tool](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/ios-project-builder-for-windows-15522) developed by Pierre-Marie Baty.
